Search problem:
----------=-
A search problem is defined by
- A set of states
- A start state
- A goal state or goal test
		- a boolean function which tells us whether a given state is a
		  goal state
A successor function
- a mapping from a state to a set of new states

Graph Search
Graph (definition)
A graph consists of
- a set N of nodes;
- a set A of ordered pairs of nodes, called arcs or edges.

Node n2 is a neighbor of n1 if there is an arc from n1 to n2.
i.e., if hn1, n2i ∈ A

Path (definition)
A path is a sequence of nodes hn0, n1, . . . , nki such that
hni−1, nii ∈ A.
Definition (solution)

Solution
Given a start node and a set of goal nodes, a solution is a path
from the start node to a goal node.
